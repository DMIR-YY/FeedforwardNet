For auto generation the user should  
<<<<<<< HEAD:codeGenerator/codeGenerator

1. make sure the net_config_params.txt and net_weights.txt has been generated and they are located at FeedforwardNet/fpga_cnn/caffe_converter folder.
2. Navigate codeGenerator folder  
3. Run generator with   ./run_generator.sh  
    It will run python scripts for generation of construct_net.h, config.h and ff_test.cpp files  
    Follow the steps as this example.       

For example: 
       (1) Please enter test image path:   
       - Then you will be prompted to enter the types of input data, weights and output data.  
        “Please enter the type of input: ”  
“Please enter the type of weights: ”  
“Please enter the type of output: ”  
- Next the path to test img is asked:  
“Please enter the path to test image”  
- Then the color specification input is asked:  
“Please the color specification input:”  
You are asked to specify if your image is colored or grayscaled one. So you should enter “color” or
“grayscale” respectively.  
- Then the height and width of the image are asked (if the image is colored one):  
“height:”  
“width:”

 -  make sure the net_config_params.txt and net_weights.txt has been generated and they are located at FeedforwardNet/fpga_cn/caffe_converter folder  
 -  Navigate codeGenerator folder    
 -  Run generator with ./run_generator.sh    
 - Follow the steps as this example.      
  
For example:   
             (1)   Please enter test image path:    
                 ../example/caffe_demos/lenet/lenet_2conv2max_relu/img   
             (2)   Please enter the type of input: float   
                   Please enter the type of weights: float   
                   Please enter the type of output: float   
             (3) Please enter the path to test image: img/lenet_2conv2max_input.txt     
             (4) Please enter the image name: lenet_2conv2max_input.txt   
             (5) Please enter color specification input (color, grayscale): grayscale    
             (6) Please enter the height of the image: 375     
             (7) Please enter the width of the image: 500

As the result, the test_demo folder is generated. The folder contains all necessary libraries and files
with 3 generated files, construct_net.h, config.h and ff_test.cpp.
